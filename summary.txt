A compact optical network terminal, comprising: a first interface coupled to a communications network; a second interface coupled to a network client, wherein the second interface is a network connectivity dongle with an optical transceiver at one end; and a processor including a circuitry and a memory coupled to the first interface and to the second interface, wherein the processor is capable of converting optical signals to electric signals, such that the network client can access the communications network thereby reducing the unnecessary splitting of equal upstream wavelengths to all the network clients in the network. The optical network terminal of claim 2, wherein the optical module is selectively configurable to support two or more of a broadband passive optical network (BPON), a gigabit-capable passive optical network (GPON), an Ethernet passive optical network (EPON), a gigabit-capable Ethernet passive optical network (GEPON) and an active Ethernet optical network. (canceled) 8. The optical network terminal of claim 1, wherein the at least one communication service with the xPON network comprises a first communication service and a second communication service, and wherein the communication service includes at least one voice communication service, a data communication service, and a video service.
